# SOC Analysis Report: Metasploitable2

---

## Executive Summary
This report provides an overview of a comprehensive vulnerability assessment conducted on a target machine. The assessment was performed to identify potential security weaknesses, analyze risk factors, and recommend mitigation strategies.

---

## 1. Methodology
### Tools Used:
- **Nmap**: For network scanning and open port detection.
- **Nikto**: For identifying potential web server vulnerabilities.
- **Droopescan**: To assess vulnerabilities in CMS installations (e.g., Drupal).
- **Metasploit**: For validating exploitability through controlled penetration testing.

### Steps:
1. **Network Scanning**: Conducted with Nmap to identify open ports and services.
2. **Web Vulnerability Analysis**: Performed with Nikto for server misconfigurations and weaknesses.
3. **CMS Vulnerability Scan**: Carried out using Droopescan to detect outdated CMS versions.
4. **Exploit Validation**: Executed using Metasploit to confirm the exploitability of detected vulnerabilities.

## 2. Findings
### Summary of Vulnerabilities Discovered:
- **Open Ports**: Critical services running on open ports (e.g., SSH on port 22, HTTP on port 80).
- **Web Vulnerabilities**: Missing security headers and outdated software versions.
- **CMS Exploits**: Outdated Drupal version susceptible to known exploits such as Drupalgeddon2.

### Detailed Vulnerability List:
1. **Nmap Scan**:
   - **Port 22 (SSH)**: Detected OpenSSH 4.7p1, known for potential vulnerabilities.
   - **Port 80 (HTTP)**: Running Apache 2.2.8, identified as outdated.

2. **Nikto Scan**:
   - **Findings**: Missing `X-Frame-Options` header, exposing the server to potential clickjacking.
   - **PHP Vulnerabilities**: Indicators of outdated PHP configurations.

3. **Droopescan Analysis**:
   - **Outcome**: Detected an outdated Drupal installation, potentially vulnerable to Drupalgeddon2 (remote code execution).

4. **Metasploit Exploit Attempt**:
   - **Validation**: Successfully identified the target as vulnerable to the `drupalgeddon2` module, confirming potential remote code execution capability.

## 3. Attack Vector Analysis
### Exploitation Potential:
- **SSH (Port 22)**: Exploitable if combined with weak password policies or known vulnerabilities in the specific version.
- **HTTP (Port 80)**: Outdated Apache versions are vulnerable to various attacks, including buffer overflows.
- **Drupal CMS**: The detected version is susceptible to code execution vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

### Impact Analysis:
- **Data Exfiltration**: Compromised systems could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Exploiting SSH or CMS vulnerabilities could allow attackers to gain elevated privileges.

## 4. Remediation Recommendations
### Immediate Steps:
- **Upgrade Services**: Update OpenSSH and Apache to their latest, secure versions.
- **Secure Headers**: Implement `X-Frame-Options` and a comprehensive `Content Security Policy` (CSP) for web services.
- **CMS Updates**: Update the Drupal installation to the latest patch to address vulnerabilities like Drupalgeddon2.
- **Access Controls**: Limit SSH access with strict IP whitelisting and enforce strong password policies.

### Long-Term Measures:
- **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule recurring vulnerability assessments.
- **Patch Management**: Maintain an automated patch management process to ensure software is up-to-date.
- **Employee Training**: Conduct cybersecurity awareness training to prevent social engineering attacks.
