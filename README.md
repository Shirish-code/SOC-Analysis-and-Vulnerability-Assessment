# SOC Analysis and Vulnerability Assessment Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive SOC (Security Operations Center) analysis involving reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and attack simulations on a victim machine. Using tools like Nmap, Nikto, Droopescan, and Metasploit, the analysis highlights common vulnerabilities and proposes remediation strategies.

## Objectives
- Identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- Demonstrate usage of security tools to conduct thorough assessments.
- Analyze findings and propose practical remedies for discovered vulnerabilities.

## Tools Used
- **Nmap**: Network mapping and vulnerability detection.
- **Nikto**: Web server scanner for detecting known vulnerabilities.
- **Droopescan**: CMS scanner for detecting Drupal vulnerabilities.
- **Metasploit**: Penetration testing framework for exploiting vulnerabilities.
